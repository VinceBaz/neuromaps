Contributing a new brain map
----------------------------

We're always eager to incorporate new brain annotations into ``neuromaps``!
While we work on putting together an automated workflow for contributing new
maps, we encourage you to reach out to the maintainers by `opening an issue
<https://github.com/netneurolab/neuromaps/issues/new?assignees=&labels=
enhancement&template=brain-map-request.yml&title=%5BENH%5D+Request+to+add+
brain+map>`_ on GitHub with information about the maps you're interested in
adding. (You can also do this if there is a journal article that has been
published with a map that you would like to see added to ``neuromaps``!)
